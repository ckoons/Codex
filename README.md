> AI-powered design and coding platform

## Overview

Forge is a next-generation design and coding platform, based on Aider, that uses artificial intelligence to help engineers, designers, and makers create optimized physical products. By combining advanced CAD/CAM capabilities with AI assistance, Forge transforms how products are designed, tested, and manufactured.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Design Assistant

- Natural language interface for creating and modifying designs
- Real-time design guidance and recommendations
- Automatic generation of design alternatives
- Design validation against manufacturing constraints

### Advanced Optimization

- Multi-parameter optimization for performance, cost, and manufacturability
- Topology optimization based on load conditions and material properties
- Weight reduction while maintaining structural integrity
- Material selection optimization based on requirements

### Manufacturing Integration

- Automatic generation of manufacturing instructions
- Support for CNC machining, 3D printing, laser cutting, and more
- Cost estimation and manufacturing time prediction
- Direct connection to manufacturing service providers

### Collaboration Tools

- Real-time collaborative design environment
- Version control and design history
- Commenting and feedback systems
- Team permissions and access control

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- GPU with CUDA support (recommended)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forge.git
cd forge
