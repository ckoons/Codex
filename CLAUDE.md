# Codex/Aider Integration Fixes and Implementation

## Current Issues Fixed

1. **Fixed Aider Adapter Error**
   - Added support for the missing `bold` parameter in the `tool_output` method
   - Made the function compatible with newer versions of Aider that expect this parameter

2. **Implemented Emergency Chat Input**
   - Created a fallback chat input UI when RIGHT FOOTER chat input can't be found
   - Added manual connection controls (Connect WebSocket, Start Session)
   - Provided visual feedback for connection state and session status

3. **Enhanced Debugging Capabilities**
   - Added comprehensive debug panel to track connection and messaging state
   - Implemented detailed logging for each step of the process
   - Categorized logs by type (info, success, error) for easier troubleshooting

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Test and Refine Aider Integration**
   - Test the connection sequence: Connect → Start Session → Send Message
   - Verify if the tool_output bold parameter fix resolves the error
   - Test compatibility with the latest Aider version

2. **UI Polish**
   - Remove or hide debug panel in production mode
   - Improve styling of emergency chat input to match Tekton UI
   - Add automatic hiding/showing of emergency chat input based on RIGHT FOOTER detection

3. **Refactor for Better Integration**
   - Streamline the WebSocket connection process
   - Improve error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Optimize message passing between components

## Implementation Notes

### Connection Sequence

The correct sequence for establishing communication with Aider:

1. **Connect WebSocket** - Establish WebSocket connection to Codex server
2. **Start Session** - Initialize an Aider session through the WebSocket
3. **Send Messages** - Only after session is active can messages be sent and received

### Error Handling

Common issues and solutions:

1. **WebSocket Connection Failure**
   - Primary URL: `ws://localhost:8082/ws/codex`
   - Fallback URL: Based on current window location
   - Error handling for both connection approaches

2. **Missing RIGHT FOOTER Input**
   - Detection of the chat input element in the UI
   - Fallback to emergency chat input when not found
   - Auto-reconnection and session restart mechanisms

3. **Session Management**
   - Auto-starting sessions when needed
   - Handling session timeout or disconnection
   - Reconnection and session recovery

### Code Structure

The implementation uses a modular approach:

1. **Core WebSocket Communication** - Handles low-level messaging
2. **Session Management** - Manages Aider sessions and state
3. **UI Components** - Provides interface elements for user interaction
4. **Debugging Tools** - Helps diagnose and fix issues during development

## Next Steps

1. Test all implementations in the development environment
2. Remove debugging elements for production
3. Document the final implementation
4. Create thorough testing procedures for QA

## Technical Requirements

- WebSocket server must be running on port 8082
- Aider must be properly installed and available
- Tekton UI must be running to integrate the component
